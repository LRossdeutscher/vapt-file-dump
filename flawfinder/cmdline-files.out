FINAL RESULTS:

cmdline/apt-dump-solver.cc:113:  [4] (shell) execv:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
cmdline/apt-dump-solver.cc:72:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
