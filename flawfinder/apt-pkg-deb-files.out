FINAL RESULTS:

deb/dpkgpm.cc:1013:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:1016:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:1032:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:2337:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:2339:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
deb/debsystem.cc:359:  [4] (shell) execvp:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:194:  [4] (shell) execv:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:490:  [4] (shell) execv:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:1997:  [4] (shell) execvp:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:2410:  [4] (shell) popen:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:2425:  [4] (shell) popen:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
deb/debsystem.cc:107:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
deb/debsystem.cc:319:  [3] (misc) chroot:
  chroot can be very helpful, but is hard to use correctly (CWE-250, CWE-22).
  Make sure the program immediately chdir("/"), closes file descriptors, and
  drops root privileges, and that all necessary files (and no more!) are in
  the new root.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:74:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
deb/dpkgpm.cc:76:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
