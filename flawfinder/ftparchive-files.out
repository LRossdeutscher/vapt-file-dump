FINAL RESULTS:

ftparchive/multicompress.cc:247:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
ftparchive/multicompress.cc:366:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
ftparchive/writer.cc:149:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
ftparchive/writer.cc:302:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
ftparchive/writer.cc:817:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
ftparchive/contents.cc:281:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
ftparchive/contents.cc:358:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
ftparchive/writer.cc:669:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
ftparchive/writer.cc:150:  [3] (buffer) realpath:
  This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some
  implementations can overflow internally (CWE-120/CWE-785!). Ensure that the
  destination buffer is at least of size MAXPATHLEN, andto protect against
  implementation problems, the input argument should also be checked to
  ensure it is no larger than MAXPATHLEN.
ftparchive/writer.cc:195:  [3] (buffer) realpath:
  This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some
  implementations can overflow internally (CWE-120/CWE-785!). Ensure that the
  destination buffer is at least of size MAXPATHLEN, andto protect against
  implementation problems, the input argument should also be checked to
  ensure it is no larger than MAXPATHLEN.
ftparchive/writer.cc:227:  [3] (buffer) realpath:
  This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some
  implementations can overflow internally (CWE-120/CWE-785!). Ensure that the
  destination buffer is at least of size MAXPATHLEN, andto protect against
  implementation problems, the input argument should also be checked to
  ensure it is no larger than MAXPATHLEN.
ftparchive/writer.cc:818:  [3] (buffer) realpath:
  This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some
  implementations can overflow internally (CWE-120/CWE-785!). Ensure that the
  destination buffer is at least of size MAXPATHLEN, andto protect against
  implementation problems, the input argument should also be checked to
